//This is a possible idea to do update with the questions. Have each button push into 
//an array either a 1 or a zero and once the number of questions equals the index length 
//minus one then 'reduce' the array and make. It will add all of their score together.
// Then have a button that will update their username and add a highscore to it.

//Also an idea is memory routing. If the questions are done by ID i can then push that 
// id into an array and possibly use memory routing to make sure that it doesn't reuse the
//question. Good research.
